abstract = "A method of finding pattern similarities between two sequences is given. Two portions, one from each sequence, are similar if they are close in the metric space of evolutionary distances. The method allows a complete list to be made of all pairs of intervals, one from each of two given sequences, such that each pair displays a maximum local degree of similarity, and, if the lengths of the given sequences are m and n, then the procedure takes on the order of mn computational steps. This result lends itself to finding similarities by computer between pairs of biological sequences, such as proteins and nucleic acids."
